I have build this website using react.js and to start the website pull the respository in your local computer and type -  npm start  ,to launch the website.

In this website there are 3 main components which are - Dashboard, CreateNews and ManageNews.
I have separated the Navbar which is named as Header in here.

Dashboard is combination of homebar and sidebar which consists of activity, content statistics, and quick links to manage news feeds or view performance reports.

CreateNews- create and publish new news feeds. It contains form fields for title, content, and category as well as the ability to upload images or videos. A unique feature of this is it can create a mobile preview screen.

ManageNews- It contains news categories and news which contains title, image and content and readmore option to fully read the content and we can filter news according to category
